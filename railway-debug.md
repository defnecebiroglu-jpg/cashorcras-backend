# Railway Deployment Debug Log

## Issue: "Application failed to respond"

### ✅ What's Working:
- Build completes successfully  
- Server starts and logs "Running on 0.0.0.0:8080"
- Local testing: All endpoints return 200 OK
- Minimal HTTP server works locally

### ❌ What's Broken:
- Railway shows "Application failed to respond" 
- External requests to Railway URL timeout
- Despite server "running" logs

### 🔍 Potential Causes:
1. **Railway Reverse Proxy**: Not routing to container properly
2. **Container Networking**: Internal Railway networking issue  
3. **Process Management**: Server starts but crashes on first request
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing Railway-specific configs
5. **File Permissions**: Static file serving permission issues

### 🧪 Debug Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Created minimal HTTP server (works locally)
2. ✅ Verified port binding to 0.0.0.0
3. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
4. ✅ Multiple server implementations tested
5. ✅ Static file path resolution fixed

### 🚀 Next Actions:
1. Deploy minimal server to Railway
2. Check Railway logs for crash details after first request
3. Test Railway-specific environment variables
4. Consider Railway networking/container issues

### 📝 Railway Deploy Config:
- **Procfile**: `web: node server/minimal.cjs`
- **Port**: Uses `process.env.PORT || 3000`
- **Host**: Binds to `0.0.0.0` 
- **Server**: Pure Node.js HTTP (no Express dependencies)
